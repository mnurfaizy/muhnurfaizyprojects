|[Cohort Analysis on Customer Retention](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QNkdippZOLcaUoi8ogDANpdDlrqnLrYN/view?usp=drive_link)|Microsft Excel|This project showcases a complete cohort and retention analysis using Excel, based on a transactional dataset from a bicycle retail business. It covers key concepts such as defining cohorts, calculating cohort indexes, and analyzing user retention trendsâ€”all without using any programming tools. Great for understanding user behavior through segmentation and time-based analysis.|

## ðŸ“‚Python: Data Analysis and Machine Learning
|**Project Link**|**Tools**|**Project Descriptions**|
|---|---|---|
|[Machine Learning for Diabetes Detection](https://github.com/mnurfaizy/diabetes_prediction)|python, google colab, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn|This project explores a diabetes dataset to uncover significant factors influencing the condition. Additionally, the project involves implementing multiple classification models and comparing their accuracy to identify the most effective predictive approach.|
|[Credit Risk Prediction](https://github.com/mnurfaizy/Credit_Analysis_and_Prediction) Associated with Rakamin Academy X IDX Partnerts|python, google colab, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn|This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based credit risk prediction model to enhance loan approval decisions and minimize financial losses. By leveraging a dataset containing 466,285 loan applications with 75 features, we analyzed key risk factors, performed rigorous data preprocessing, and tested multiple classification models to accurately predict loan default probability.|
|[Customer Segmentation using RFM Scoring and K-Means Clustering](https://github.com/mnurfaizy/customer_segmentation_using_rfm_kmeans_clustering)|python, google colab, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn|This project applies RFM Scoring and K-Means Clustering to the UCI Online Retail dataset, segmenting customers based on recency, frequency, and monetary value. The analysis identifies 7 distinct customer segments (including outliers) and provides tailored strategies for retention, reactivation, and growth. These insights enable data-driven marketing, optimized resource allocation, and improved long-term customer value.|

## ðŸ“‚Dashboard
|**Project Link**|**Tools**|**Project Descriptions**|
